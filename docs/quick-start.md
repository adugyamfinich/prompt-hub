## 🎯 What is PromptHub?

PromptHub is a collection of high-quality, tested prompts for AI models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini. Think of it as a recipe book for AI interactions.

## 🚀 Using a Prompt (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Find a Prompt

**Browse by what you need:**
- [Coding](../prompts/by-category/coding/) - Debug, generate, review code
- [Writing](../prompts/by-category/writing/) - Articles, emails, creative content
- [Analysis](../prompts/by-category/analysis/) - Data interpretation, research
- [Creative](../prompts/by-category/creative/) - Stories, art, brainstorming
- [Education](../prompts/by-category/education/) - Teaching, learning, explaining
- [Research](../prompts/by-category/research/) - Literature review, hypothesis

**Or search by keyword:**
```
Use GitHub search: #python #debugging
```

### Step 2: Customize the Prompt

Each prompt has variables marked like `{THIS}`. Replace them with your specific needs.

**Example:**

Original prompt:
```
You are a {EXPERTISE} expert. Help me {TASK} by {METHOD}.
```

Your version:
```
You are a Python expert. Help me debug my code by explaining each error.
```

### Step 3: Use It

Copy your customized prompt and paste it into:
- Claude (claude.ai)
- ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)
- Gemini (gemini.google.com)
- Any compatible AI tool

## 📖 Reading a Prompt File

Each prompt follows this structure:

```markdown
# Prompt Name

## Metadata
Quick info: category, difficulty, which AI models work

## Description

```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Examples

Look at the "Example Input/Output" section first to see if the prompt does what you need.

### 2. Check Model Compatibility

Make sure the prompt works with your AI model:
- ✅ "Model Compatibility: All Models" = works everywhere
- ⚠️ "Model Compatibility: Claude" = optimized for Claude

### 3. Read Performance Notes

The "Limitations" section tells you when the prompt might not work well.

### 4. Adjust as Needed

Prompts are templates! Feel free to modify them for your specific needs.

## 🎓 Difficulty Levels
